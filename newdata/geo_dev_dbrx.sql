1. First, we need to find the state with the largest city in the US. To do this, we can use the "city" and "state" entities from the schema. We can join these two entities on the "state_name" attribute, and then find the state that has the city with the maximum population. The SQL query for this would be:
```
SELECT s.state_name
FROM city c
JOIN state s ON c.state_name = s.state_name
WHERE c.country_name = 'US'
GROUP BY s.state_name
ORDER BY MAX(c.population) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
2. Next, we need to find the rivers that run through this state. To do this, we can use the "river" and "state" entities from the schema. We can join these two entities on the "state_name" attribute, and then filter the results for the state we found in step 1. The SQL query for this would be:
```
SELECT r.river_name
FROM river r
JOIN state s ON r.state_name = s.state_name
WHERE s.state_name = ['state_name from step 1']
```
3. Combining both the queries we get the final query:
```
SELECT r.river_name
FROM river r
JOIN state s ON r.state_name = s.state_name
WHERE s.state_name = (
    SELECT s.state_name
    FROM city c
    JOIN state s ON c.state_name = s.state_name
    WHERE c.country_name = 'US'
    GROUP BY s.state_name
    ORDER BY MAX(c.population) DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
```
This query will give us the names of the rivers that run through the state with the largest city in the US.
1. First, we need to find the largest state. To do this, we can write a SQL query to get the state with the maximum area. Here's the SQL query for that:
```sql
SELECT state_name 
FROM state 
ORDER BY area DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
This query will return the state_name of the state with the largest area.

2. Next, we need to find the smallest city in that state. To do this, we can write another SQL query to get the city with the minimum population in the state we obtained from the previous query. Here's the SQL query for that:
```vbnet
SELECT city_name 
FROM city 
WHERE state_name = 'largest_state_name' 
ORDER BY population ASC 
LIMIT 1;
```
Replace 'largest_state_name' with the actual state_name we obtained from the first query.

3. The final SQL query that combines both queries is as follows:
```vbnet
SELECT c.city_name 
FROM city c 
JOIN state s ON c.state_name = s.state_name 
WHERE s.area = (SELECT MAX(area) FROM state) 
ORDER BY c.population ASC 
LIMIT 1;
```
This query will return the city_name of the smallest city in the largest state.1. First, we need to identify the tables and columns involved in the question. The question mentions "states surrounding Mississippi" and "highest points". From the schema, we can see that the "state" table contains the "state_name" column, which we can use to identify states. The "highlow" table contains the "state_name" column as well as the "highest_point" column, which we can use to identify the highest points of each state.
2. We need to find the states that border Mississippi. To do this, we can look at the "border_info" table, which contains the "state_name" column for each state as well as the "border" column, which lists the names of the states that border each state.
3. We can join the "border_info" table with the "state" table on the "state_name" column to get the names of the states that border Mississippi. We can then join this result with the "highlow" table on the "state_name" column to get the highest points of those states.
4. Here is the SQL query that corresponds to these steps:

SQL:
```
SELECT hl.highest_point
FROM highlow hl
JOIN state s ON hl.state_name = s.state_name
JOIN border_info bi ON s.state_name = bi.state_name
WHERE bi.border = 'Mississippi'
```
This query will return the highest points of the states that border Mississippi.1. First, we need to find the state that borders the most states.
SQL:
```
SELECT state_name, COUNT(*) as num_borders
FROM border_info
GROUP BY state_name
ORDER BY num_borders DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
2. Next, we need to find the states that border the state found in step 1.
SQL:
```
SELECT state_name
FROM border_info
WHERE border = <state_name_from_step_1>;
```
3. Then, we need to find the rivers that pass through the states found in step 2.
SQL:
```
SELECT river_name
FROM river
WHERE state_name IN (<list_of_states_from_step_2>);
```
4. Finally, we need to find the longest river from the rivers found in step 3.
SQL:
```
SELECT river_name, length
FROM river
WHERE river_name IN (<list_of_rivers_from_step_3>)
ORDER BY length DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
The full SQL query would be:
```
SELECT r.river_name, r.length
FROM river r
WHERE r.river_name IN (
    SELECT r.river_name
    FROM river r
    WHERE r.state_name IN (
        SELECT b.state_name
        FROM border_info b
        WHERE b.border = (
            SELECT b.state_name
            FROM border_info b
            GROUP BY b.state_name
            ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
            LIMIT 1
        )
    )
)
ORDER BY r.length DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
This query will give you the name and length of the longest river that passes through the states that border the state that borders the most states.The schema you've provided is a JSON object that describes the structure of a database. It includes the types of entities (such as cities, lakes, rivers, etc.), the attributes of those entities (like the name, population, etc.), and how those entities are connected to one another.

To answer your question "what states have no bordering state?", we need to identify states that do not have any state connected to them in the `border_info` entity. Here's how we can translate this question into an SQL query:

1. First, we need to understand that the `border_info` entity is where state borders are defined in this schema. Each record in this entity has a `state_name` and a `border` attribute. If a state has no bordering state, then it should not have a record in the `border_info` table.

2. To find states with no bordering states, we can write an SQL query that selects states that do not have a record in the `border_info` table. This is typically done using a `NOT EXISTS` or `NOT IN` clause in SQL.

3. Here's the SQL query that would answer your question:

   ```sql
   SELECT state_name
   FROM state
   WHERE state_name NOT IN (
       SELECT state_name
       FROM border_info
       WHERE border IS NOT NULL
   );
   ```

   This query first selects all states from the `state` table. It then filters out states that have a corresponding record in the `border_info` table where the `border` attribute is not NULL. The remaining states are those that have no bordering states.

4. Note that the inner query needs to check for `NULL` values in the `border` field because if a state does not have any bordering state, then its record in the `border_info` table would have a NULL value for the `border`. The `NOT NULL` condition ensures that we only consider border records that have a value for the `border` attribute, which represents an actual border with another state.

5. The main query then only selects states from the `state` table that are not in the list of states with borders returned by the inner query, which gives us the list of states with no bordering states.
