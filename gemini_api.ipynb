       "> * **Not interested in romantic relationships:**  Some people are aromantic or asexual, meaning they experience little to no romantic or sexual attraction.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **External Factors:**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Limited social opportunities:** Aadi's environment or lifestyle might not provide many chances to meet potential partners. \n",
       "> * **Shyness or social anxiety:** He might find it difficult to put himself out there and connect with new people.\n",
       "> * **Past experiences:** Negative past relationships could make him hesitant to get involved again.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Other Possibilities:**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **He might be secretly dating someone.**\n",
       "> * **He could be actively searching for a partner but hasn't found the right person yet.** \n",
       "> \n",
       "> Ultimately, the reason why Aadi doesn't have a girlfriend is personal and can only be fully understood by him.\n"
